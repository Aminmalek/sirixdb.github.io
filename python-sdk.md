## Introduction

The python SDK for provides a simple, intuitive API for accessing the SirixDB REST-API. It can be used both with synchronous code, or with asynchronous code.

This document is a tutorial for using the python SDK (henceforth: pysirix), including running SirixDB locally using docker.

## Setting up SirixDB locally

Unfortunately, this is currently a bit messy, but still rather straightforward.

There are several resources required to run SirixDB, and they can all be found [here](https://github.com/sirixdb/sirix-python-client/tree/master/tests/resources).

SirixDB depends on keycloak for authentication, so we first need to run (in the directory in which you have the above resources):

```bash
docker-compose up -d keycloak
```

It can take about a minute for keycloak to be ready for connections. If you like, you can use the `wait.sh` script in the above mentioned resources folder to wait until keycloak is ready. The docker-compose file runs a script from the resources folder to initialize keycloak with a user "admin" with the password "admin".

Once keycloak is ready, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d server
```

The Sirix database is now ready for use.

## Getting started with `pysirix`

`pysirix` is essentially a thin wrapper around the [`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org/) library, and pysirix requires you to initialize the httpx client directly:

```python
>>> import pysirix
>>> import httpx

>>> client = httpx.Client(base_url="https://localhost:9443", verify=<path/to/cert.pem/in/resources/folder>)
>>> sirix = pysirix.sirix_sync("admin", "admin", client)
```

We now have a `Sirix` class instance, from which we can start interfacing with the database.

This is also where the only under-the-hood operation occurs in pysirix. The `sirix_sync` function calls `sirix.authenticate()`, which both retrieves an access token (using the first two parameters to `sirix_sync` as username and password), and starts a thread to periodically refresh that access token.

Should you want to use the asynchronous version of pysirix, you can run the REPL using IPython or (with python 3.8) `python -m asyncio`, and do the following:

```python
>>> import pysirix
>>> import httpx

>>> client = httpx.AsyncClient(base_url="https://localhost:9443", verify=<path/to/cert.pem/in/resources/folder>)
>>> sirix = await pysirix.sirix_async("admin", "admin", client)
```

In async mode, any method that will do a network request must be awaited, while any method that returns a pysirix object should not be awaited (excepting the `sirix_async` function). The rest of this tutorial will use async mode, to make it obvious which methods are doing network requests, and which are not.

## Creating databases and resources

```python
>>> from pysirix import DBType

>>> db = sirix.database("test-json-database", DBType.JSON)
```

We now have a database object, but it doesn't exist on the server yet.
For that we need to call the create method:

```python
>>> await db.create()
```

Generally, however, it is unnecessary to explicitly create a database, as it will be created implicitly when a resource belonging to it is created. Like so:

```python
>>> resource = db.resource("test-json-resource")
>>> await resource.create([])
```

The create method needs some data with which to instantiate the resource, so we have passed in an array. Alternatively, you could pass in a dictionary.

The array we passed in is empty, but this is arbitrary. We could, for example, do the following:

```python
>>> await resource.create(["blah", {"a key": 5}])
```

Something to keep in mind is that calling `resource.create()` on an existing resource *will overwrite* any previous data in the resource. So, before calling `resource.create()`, it is good practice to call:

```python
>>> exists = await resource.exists()
```

Where the `exists` variable is a `bool`, indicating whether or not the resource already exists.
